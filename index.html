            <p>Hello! My name is Steven Cantando. I am from Springfield, Pennsylvania, and I am 24
                years old. My hobbies
                include listening to music, as well as playing it. I love all of the percussion instruments! My favorite
                band, for many reasons, is The Red Hot Chili Peppers. This band also includes my favorite drummer! I
                have seen the band four times in concert, and hope to see them four more!</p>

            <p>As much as music means to me, my first love was always hockey. I played competitive hockey for 18
                years. I am now moved on from the competitive playing aspect of the sport, but still find ways to incorporate
                hockey into my everyday life. Whether it is watching NHL games, to coaching minor hockey, to playing for fun,
                this sport will always be more than a game to me.</p>
